            You go down a road, and soon you hear seagulls squawking and you smell the ocean breeze. 
            Now you are on the beach. To the right you see a group of caves, and in front of you is 
            the ocean. You decide to:
            <ul><li>go into the ocean for a nice swim</li><li>explore the caves</li><li>look around the beach for shells</li></ul>
